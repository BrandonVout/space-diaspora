## Description:
Unofficial Space Invaders Sequel.

Inspired by ‘The War of the Worlds’.

With Mars being overrun by the toxic red weed, the dying Martian race launched an invasion of Earth to secure their future. They lost.

Now the lone survivor of the invasion returns home to find Mars overrun and its people fled. The Martian rigs the planet to blow up to stop the weed from spreading to other worlds. Now it must escape before it destroys the planet.

What home means to the Martian is a memory of a once great people letting out its last gasp of air. Its home, like this memory, is fading and about to be forgotten.

6-bit inspired graphics. Break the cyan objects and avoid the magenta objects.
